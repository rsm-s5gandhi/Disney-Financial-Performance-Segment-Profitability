## Overview
This project analyzes The Walt Disney Company’s financial performance using publicly available FY2022–FY2024 Form 10-K data. The goal is to translate statutory financial disclosures into an executive-level Tableau dashboard that highlights company-wide performance and segment economics.

The analysis is designed to reflect how financial planning, business intelligence, and strategy teams use data internally to support leadership discussions and decision-making.

---

## Objectives
- Summarize Disney’s overall financial health through key performance indicators
- Compare revenue scale versus profitability across business segments
- Present insights in a clear, executive-friendly format rather than raw financial tables

---

## Data Sources
All data used in this project was sourced from:
- **The Walt Disney Company Form 10-K filings (FY2022–FY2024)**
- SEC EDGAR public disclosures

Key extracted datasets include:
- Consolidated income statement metrics
- Segment-level revenue and operating income

All values are reported in USD and normalized for consistency.

---

## Tools Used
- **Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public** – dashboard design and visualization
- **Microsoft Excel** – data extraction, normalization, and metric calculations

---

## Dashboard Structure
The Tableau dashboard is structured as a single, cohesive executive view:

### 1. Executive KPIs
- Total Revenue
- Operating Income
- Net Income
- Operating Margin
- Net Margin

These KPIs provide a high-level snapshot of Disney’s financial performance over time.

### 2. Segment Analysis
- Revenue by Business Segment (Entertainment, Experiences, Sports)
- Operating Income by Business Segment

This comparison highlights differences between revenue contribution and profitability across Disney’s business lines.

---

## Key Insights
- **Experiences is Disney’s primary profit driver**, delivering the highest operating income and margins despite not being the largest revenue contributor.
- **Entertainment generates the largest share of revenue** but operates at lower margins relative to Experiences.
- **Revenue remains heavily concentrated in the Americas**, with Europe and Asia Pacific representing meaningful but smaller contributions.

These insights demonstrate that revenue scale does not always translate to profitability and highlight the importance of margin-focused decision-making.

---

## Business Relevance
This project demonstrates how financial statement data can be transformed into actionable business intelligence. The dashboard format mirrors how FP&A and BI teams present insights to leadership, supporting:
- Capital allocation discussions
- Segment prioritization
- Performance monitoring
- Strategic planning
